Hello, I'm Rachael Mabela!

The ever-evolving world of cybersecurity has always fascinated me. The intricate puzzles of network security, and the responsibility of protecting valuable digital assets – these are the things that fuel my passion for this dynamic field.

I recently obtained my ISC² Cybersecurity certification, solidifying my foundational knowledge and demonstrating my commitment to the profession. However, I'm eager to take the next step and translate that knowledge into real-world experience.

Objective:

An entry-level Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst (Tier 1) position particularly excites me. I believe this role would be a perfect springboard for my career, allowing me to actively participate in incident detection, analysis, and response while working alongside experienced professionals. I'm a fast learner with a strong work ethic, and I'm confident that I can quickly become a valuable asset to your team.
